# Scripting Lab â€“ Tools, Helpers & CTF Scripts

This repository contains a collection of small scripts and helpers I've written during my journey through cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system administration.  
Some of these were created during Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, others for automation or general tooling.

> **Disclaimer:** These scripts are intended for educational and demonstrative purposes only. Do not use them in production environments unless you fully understand what they do.

## Work in Progress

This repository is updated as I grow and sharpen my skills. Some scripts are quick & dirty by design (e.g. CTF tools), while others follow cleaner standards.

## Responsibility

Please use responsibly. Hacking and scanning tools should **never be run on systems without permission**. I do not take any responsibility for misuse.
