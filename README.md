Here I have some of my scripted tools that i needed while doing ctf things.
Some of these tools are tailored for specific CTF challenges, offering specialized functionality, other for regular pentest use. 
I haven't assessed the potential disruption caused by these scripts, thus I advise against deploying them in a production environment.
